"""
Cross-connector OAuth port lock.

rclone's OAuth callback server binds to a single hardcoded port (53682) for
every backend that uses its bundled OAuth client (Google Drive, OneDrive, ...).
Only ONE OAuth flow can be active at a time across ALL connectors — if a
second `rclone authorize` subprocess starts while another is still waiting for
its callback, the second one will fail to bind :53682 and crash silently.

Each connector module (gdrive_rclone, onedrive_rclone, ...) registers a
zero-arg getter that returns its current sessions. `has_active_oauth()` scans
all registered iterables for a session whose `status == "awaiting_oauth"`.
